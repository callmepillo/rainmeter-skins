# wcbb-suite
A suite of skins that I've created or modified to my liking.

Some of the skins may be plug-and-play, but others may require some simple tinkerings with the .ini file.

•Desktop example:

# Veter (WIP)
A weather widget based on open-meteo:

![veter](images/veter.png)

Notice that in the layout (Rainmeter.ini) I've used the monstercat-visualizer for my desktop, but I decided not to bundle it in the WCBB (WinCanBeBeautiful) Suite.

The visualizer can be obtained here: https://github.com/marcopixel/monstercat-visualizer

Verticons should be configured to ones liking.

A Weather widget is in works.
