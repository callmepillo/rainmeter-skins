# Colck
Four variantions of a modern clock:

•With seconds

![colck_secs](images/colck_secs.png)

•With week day

![colck_week](images/colck_week.png)

•With week day & seconds

![colck_secs_week](images/colck_secs_week.png)

# Simplecisum
These include a clock with 2 variations, a music player with 2 variations and a dock/launcher.

Notice that in the layout (Rainmeter.ini) I've used the monstercat-visualizer for my desktop, but I decided not to bundle it in the WCBB (WinCanBeBeautiful) Suite.

The visualizer can be obtained here: https://github.com/marcopixel/monstercat-visualizer

Verticons should be configured to ones liking.

A Weather widget is in works.
